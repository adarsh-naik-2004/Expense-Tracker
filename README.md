## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone
https://github.com/adarsh-naik-2004/Expense-Tracker.git
cd Expense-Tracker
```

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a **.env** file in the `backend` directory and set the required environment variables:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   PORT=5000
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server should start on `http://localhost:5000/`

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```sh
   cd ../frontendd
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a **.env** file in the `frontend` directory and set the required environment variables:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```
4. Start the frontend server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend should be available on `http://localhost:3000/`

## Approach Taken

### 1. Database Setup
- **MongoDB Atlas**:
  - Chosen for its cloud-hosted database solution, eliminating local database management.
  - Database structure includes:
    - **User** schema: Stores user details and transactions.
    - **Transaction** schema: Stores transaction details like amount, category, date, and user association.
  - Proper access controls ensure secure connections, with monitoring enabled.

---

### 2. JWT Authentication Implementation
- **Login Flow**:
  - Upon login, a JWT is generated and stored in HTTP-only cookies.
- **Middleware**:
  - Validates JWT for protected routes.
- **Token Expiry & Refresh**:
  - JWT expires after a set duration, and a refresh mechanism keeps users logged in.

---

### 3. Expense Management
- **Features**:
  - **Add Transaction**: Users can record expenses.
  - **View Transactions**: Users can list and sort transactions.
  - **Delete Transaction**: Users can remove transactions.
- **Backend Implementation**:
  - RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.

---

### 4. Spending Insights
- **Purpose**:
  - Provide an overview of spending habits.
- **Features**:
  - **Total Spending**: Aggregates all transactions.
  - **Category Breakdown**: Displays categorized spending.
  - **Monthly Trends**: Analyzes trends over time.
- **Backend Implementation**:
  - Uses aggregation to summarize transaction data.

---

### 5. Frontend Implementation
- **React & Material-UI**:
  - UI components ensure a modern, responsive design.
- **State Management**:
  - Context API maintains global state.
- **Charts & Graphs**:
  - Recharts library visualizes spending insights.

---

### 6. Security Measures
- **Password Hashing**:
  - Ensures stored passwords remain encrypted.
- **JWT Storage**:
  - Stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Data Validation**:
  - Input validation on both client and server sides.

---

### 7. Performance Considerations
- **Database Optimization**:
  - Indexing and connection pooling for efficient queries.
- **Backend Optimization**:
  - Well-structured API endpoints and error handling.
- **Frontend Optimization**:
  - React optimizations like lazy loading and efficient state management.
